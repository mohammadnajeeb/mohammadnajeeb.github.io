# Building a Modern Web Portfolio with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

## Introduction

Creating a personal portfolio website is an essential step for any academic or professional in tech. In this post, I'll share my experience building this portfolio website using fundamental web technologies.

## Key Components

### 1. Responsive Design
I implemented a mobile-first approach using CSS media queries to ensure the website looks great on all devices.

### 2. Navigation System
The navigation menu was built to be intuitive and accessible, with clear pathways to different sections:
- Publications
- Projects
- Experience
- Social Media Integration

### 3. Performance Optimization
Some key optimizations I implemented:
- Minified CSS and JavaScript files
- Optimized image loading
- Efficient asset organization

## Code Snippet
Here's an example of the responsive navigation CSS:

```css
nav {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    padding: 1rem;
}

@media (max-width: 768px) {
    nav {
        flex-direction: column;
        align-items: center;
    }
}
